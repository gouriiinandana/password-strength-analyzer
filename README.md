# password-strength-analyzer

Creating a utility to evaluate password strength, detect weaknesses, and recommend secure password practices involves several steps. Below is a Python implementation of such a utility:

# Step 1: Define Password Strength Criteria
Length of the password
Use of uppercase and lowercase letters
Use of digits
Use of special characters
Avoiding common passwords
Avoiding patterns and repeated sequences

# Step 2: Create the Password Strength Evaluation Function
This function will evaluate the password based on the criteria and return a score along with feedback on weaknesses and recommendations.

# Step 3: Implementation 

This utility evaluates the password based on the defined criteria and provides a score out of 6, along with specific feedback and recommendations. You can further customize the criteria and feedback as needed.
